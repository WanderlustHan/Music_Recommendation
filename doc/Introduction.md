# Title
Music Recommendation for Infrequent Users

# Challenge
Some users barely listen musics. Sometimes it's not because they don't like music, but it's hard for them to obtain musics that satisfy their taste. This scenerio is caused by the lack of training data for this kind of user, which cannot be well solved by the method that is focused on unbalance problem. And it also cannot be sovled by the algorithm which is targeted at cold-start problem, as users in this scenerio are not new users without training data.
